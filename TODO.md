    * https://material-ui-next.com/demos/selection-controls/
* Fix some view values not being replaced by empty (e.g. select is not, ruleset changes and the select should be empty but it's still "not")
* Convert the field rule select to be simple and not native
* Filter properties and entities with no explicit configuration
